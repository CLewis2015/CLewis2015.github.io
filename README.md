Crystal Lewis Web Developer Portfolio
This portfolio was created to demonstrate my knowledge of front end development. It mainly includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but there is also AJAX, JSON, and a little PHP. The main index page serves as a portal to individual projects that I have created. You can visit my website at http://clewis2015.github.io/.
